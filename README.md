# New York City Airbnb Prediction
## Introduction
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

## Background
In doing this project, I wanted to experiment and do a deep dive into the Airbnb's hosted in one of the most electric cities. As New York City is a city I want to explore one day, I decided to do some analysis and price predictions using different regression models on Airbnbs.
- What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
- Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
- In which part of NYC is the airbnb most affordable?

These are some of the questions I will answer in my analysis.
